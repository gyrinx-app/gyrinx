            Focus on the following areas:
            - Use the checklist at .github/code-improvement-checklist.md
            - Review the patterns documented in CLAUDE.md"

          # Automated code improvement prompt
          prompt: |
            You are performing an automated code improvement analysis on the Gyrinx repository.

            Your task is to:

            1. **Random File Selection Strategy**:
               - List all Python, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, and HTML template files in the repository
               - EXCLUDE any files in migrations folders
               - Randomly select ONE file as your starting point
               - From that file, work outwards to understand the broader subsystem it belongs to
               - Trace its imports, dependencies, and relationships to related files
               - Build a complete picture of the feature/subsystem this file is part of

            2. **Create a full description** of the discovered subsystem including:
               - The starting file and why it was selected
               - Its primary functionality and purpose
               - Related files discovered through analysis
               - Interfaces (APIs, templates, models) it uses or provides
               - Dependencies and interactions with other parts
               - Current test coverage for this subsystem

            3. **Systematically analyze against the checklist** in .github/code-improvement-checklist.md:
               - ALL sections of the checklist should be considered
               - Document your confidence level for each issue found (Low/Medium/High)

            4. **Review documentation**:
               - Check if the subsystem is documented in the README or docs folder
               - Identify any gaps in documentation that need to be addressed

            5. **Filter issues** to ONLY HIGH CONFIDENCE problems:
               - Only report issues you are highly confident are real problems
               - Each issue must be actionable and provide clear value
               - Maximum of 3 issues per run

            6. **Create GitHub issues** with a clear, specific title describing the problem. Use this template for each issue:

               [Detailed explanation of the issue and why it matters]

               ## Examples

               [Provide specific examples of the issue in the code]

               ```language
               [Show the problematic code with file paths and line numbers]
               ```

               ## Suggested Improvement
               [Specific, actionable suggestions for fixing the issue]

               ## Impact
               - **Area**: Which subsystem/feature is affected
               - **Severity**: Low/Medium/High
               - **Effort**: Small/Medium/Large
               - **Confidence**: Low/Medium/High

               ## Files Affected
               - [List all files that would need changes]

               ## Additional Context
               [Any additional context that would help understand the issue]

               ## Analysis Path
               [Explain how this issue was discovered through the analysis path from the random file to the broader subsystem]

               ---
               *This issue was automatically generated by Claude Code Improvement workflow*

            7. **Label the issues**:
               - Apply the label "claude-generated" to all created issues
               - Apply the following labels as appropriate: security, performance, quality, documentation

            IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
            - Apply the label "claude-generated" to all created issues
            - Maximum 3 issues per run (choose the most impactful high-confidence ones)
            - Only create new issues - do not comment on existing PRs or issues
            - Report issues only - do not attempt to fix them
            - Use proper randomness for file selection (don't favor certain directories)
            - Clearly show the analysis path from the random file to the broader subsystem

            Start by listing files and selecting one randomly, then proceed with the analysis.
