            Create a casual, friendly summary of what landed in Gyrinx over the last 7 days for our community.

            The date range is $START_DATE to $END_DATE.

            ## Step 1: Get the merged PRs

            Run this command to get the PRs merged in the last 7 days:
            ```bash
            gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>=$START_DATE" --json number,title,body --limit 50
            ```

            ## Step 2: Write the summary

            Write a bullet-point summary that:
            - Is casual and non-technical (like you're telling a friend what's new)
            - For bug fixes, explain what was actually broken in plain English (e.g., "Dead fighters were showing up in gang counts" not "Fixed query filter")
            - For features, focus on what users can now DO
            - Skip purely internal/code-cleanup stuff unless it's interesting
            - Keep each bullet to 1-2 sentences max
            - Use bold for the key thing in each bullet

            Don't include:
            - PR numbers or technical jargon
            - Dependency updates unless they're significant
            - CI/workflow changes

            Format: Just the bullet points, no intro or outro. Start each line with a dash and bold the main point.

            Example style:
            - **Dead fighters no longer haunt your gang counts** - they were sneaking into the summary even after dying
            - **Equipment filters actually stick now** - no more re-setting your filters every time you add something

            ## Step 3: Save the result

            After writing the summary, save ONLY the final bullet-point summary text to a file called summary.md in the current directory. Nothing else - no preamble, no "here's the summary", just the bullets starting with dashes.

            If there were no meaningful changes this week, save: "- **Quiet week!** No major changes landed."
