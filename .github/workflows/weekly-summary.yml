            Create a summary of what landed in Gyrinx over the last 7 days.

            The date range is $START_DATE to $END_DATE.

            ## Step 1: Get the merged PRs

            Run this command to get the PRs merged in the last 7 days:
            ```bash
            gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>=$START_DATE" --json number,title,body --limit 50
            ```

            ## Step 2: Write the summary

            Start with a short intro like "Changes from January 4th to 11th:" followed by a one-sentence overall summary of the week.

            Then write bullet points that:
            - Use British English spellings (e.g., "organised" not "organized", "colour" not "color")
            - Are casual but slightly technical (aimed at users who understand the app)
            - For bug fixes, explain what was broken in plain terms (e.g., "Dead fighters were showing up in gang counts" not "Fixed query filter")
            - For features, focus on what's now possible
            - Use impersonal language (not "your gang" but "gangs" or "the gang page")
            - Skip purely internal/code-cleanup stuff unless it's interesting
            - Keep each bullet to 1-2 sentences max
            - Use bold for the key thing in each bullet

            Don't include:
            - PR numbers
            - Dependency updates unless they're significant
            - CI/workflow changes
            - Admin interface changes (at most one bullet if significant)

            Format: Intro line, blank line, then bullet points starting with dashes.

            Example style:
            Changes from January 4th to 11th: A week of bug fixes and UI polish.

            - **Dead fighters no longer appear in gang counts** - they were sneaking into the summary even after dying
            - **Equipment filters persist** when adding items, instead of resetting each time

            If there were no meaningful user-facing changes, return: "Changes from [date range]: Quiet week! No major updates."

            Return the full summary in the structured output.
