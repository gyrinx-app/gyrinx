## Microcopy Guidelines

### Casing

Use sentence case for UI text. Title case proper nouns only.

**Proper nouns (title case):**

- Campaign
- Action
- Asset
- Gang
- Fighter
- Territory
- Resource

**Linking words (lowercase):**

- from, to, and, or, the, a, an, in, on, for, with

### Examples

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| Copy from another Campaign | Copy From Another Campaign |
| Add a Gang to this Campaign | Add A Gang To This Campaign |
| Assets and Resources | Assets And Resources |
| Copy to Campaign | Copy To Campaign |
| Create new Asset | Create New Asset |

### Button Labels

- Use action verbs: "Add", "Create", "Copy", "Remove"
- Keep labels concise: "Next", "Cancel", "Save"
- Arrow icons go after text for forward actions: "Next →"
- Arrow icons go before text for back actions: "← Back"
