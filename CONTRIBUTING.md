# Contributing to Gyrinx

## How is the Gyrinx codebase & project run?

We'd love to get your contributions to Gyrinx. The best way to identify how to
contribute is to use Gyrinx and spot improvements!

While we are in a rapid development phase, the project is run
[BDFL-style](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life):

- [@tgvashworth](https://github.com/tgvashworth) is the final decision-maker on
  all aspects of design, development and operations
- Decision-making will be done in a benevolent-but-autocratic style, with some
  decisions delegated by expertise
- This may change as the project evolves, but it is the right choice for a very
  early project that is moving quickly
