## How is the Gyrinx codebase & project run?

We'd love to get your contributions to Gyrinx. The best way to identify how to contribute is to use Gyrinx and spot improvements!

While we are in a rapid development phase, the project is run [BDFL-style](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life):

- [@tgvashworth](https://github.com/tgvashworth) is the final decision-maker on all aspects of design, development and operations
- Decision making will be done in a benvolent-but-autocratic style, with some decisions delegated by expertise
- This may change as the project evolves, but it is the right choice for a very early project that is moving quickly
