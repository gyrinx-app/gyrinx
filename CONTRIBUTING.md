## How to contribute to Gyrinx

Before contributing, read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) — by joining the community, you're agreeing to adhere to the contents of that document.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Gyrinx**, and instead [email hella@gyrinx.app](mailto:hello@gyrinx.app).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/gyrinx-app/gyrinx/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/gyrinx-app/gyrinx/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/1337524316987985963/1337860878782955590) channel on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/jamrJPYC) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code or content?**

- Ask any question about Gyrinx code & internals on the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/1337524316987985963/1337860878782955590) channel.
