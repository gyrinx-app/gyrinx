# Security Baseline - Bandit Analysis

This document provides context for the Bandit security baseline established on 2025-06-28.

## Overview

The Gyrinx codebase uses [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) for automated security scanning. The baseline captures the current state of security findings to:

1. Track only new security issues in CI/CD
2. Document accepted security risks
3. Plan security improvements over time

## Baseline Files

- **`bandit/bandit-baseline.json`** - Machine-readable baseline for CI comparison (committed to git)
- **`bandit/bandit-baseline.txt`** - Human-readable report with detailed findings (committed to git)

## Running Bandit

```bash
# Run scan with baseline comparison (as CI does)
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r . --baseline bandit/bandit-baseline.json

# Generate new baseline files
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r . -f json -o bandit/bandit-baseline.json
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r . -f txt -o bandit/bandit-baseline.txt
```

## Updating the Baseline

When security issues are resolved or new acceptable findings are added:

1. Run Bandit to generate new baseline files
2. Review the changes carefully
3. Commit both JSON and TXT files with explanation

## Configuration

Bandit is configured in `pyproject.toml` with the following exclusions:

- **B101**: Assert statements (needed for tests)
- **B601**: Paramiko calls (not used)
- **B603**: Subprocess without shell=True (reviewed case-by-case)
